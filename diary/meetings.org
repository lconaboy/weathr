A note of things to talk about at meetings with Frazer and maybe some notes too.

* Meetings
** 
*** Agenda
    1. Literature Review/Introduction
      - what sort of things should we be putting in?
      - how much physics do we need?
      - do we need to put in other people's figures?
      - see if he would read over a new draft
    2. Cleaned up data
      - we have restructured the data
    3. Weird artefacts in NDVI data
    4. Is there a way to correlate NDVI and cloud coverage (i.e. +1
       for strong correlation, 0 for no correlation, -1 for strong
       anticorrelation). Thinking specifically of the band of
       vegetation in central Africa, the band of cloud coverage and
       vegetation move together.
    5. Cloud fraction seems quite low (maybe?)
    6. What would be the best way to quantify vegetation coverage
