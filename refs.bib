    abstract = { Abstract A review is given of the meaning of the term "El NiÃƒÂ±o" and how it has changed in time, so there is no universal single definition. This needs to be recognized for scientific uses, and precision can only be achieved if the particular definition is identified in each use to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding. For quantitative purposes, possible definitions are explored that match the El NiÃƒÂ±os identified historically after 1950, and it is suggested that an El NiÃƒÂ±o can be said to occur if 5-month running means of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the NiÃƒÂ±o 3.4 region (5Ã‚Â°NÃ¢Â€Â“5Ã‚Â°S, 120Ã‚Â°Ã¢Â€Â“170Ã‚Â°W) exceed 0.4Ã‚Â°C for 6 months or more. With this definition, El NiÃƒÂ±os occur 31\% of the time and La NiÃƒÂ±as (with an equivalent definition) occur 23\% of the time. The histogram of NiÃƒÂ±o 3.4 SST anomalies reveals a bimodal character. An advantage of such a definition is that it allows the beginning, end, duration, and magnitude of each event to be quantified. Most El NiÃƒÂ±os begin in the northern spring or perhaps summer and peak from November to January in sea surface temperatures. }

    abstract = { Abstract During the period 1997?2000, the global climate system experienced a transition from the strongest ENSO warm event this century in 1997/98 to a strong cold event in 1999/2000. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument aboard the NOAA polar-orbiting satellite series were analyzed to resolve the land surface response patterns over Africa during this period. The rearrangement of precipitation patterns induced by the change from El Niño to La Niña conditions had significant effects on biomass production in arid and semiarid lands of Africa as revealed by NDVI anomaly patterns, particularly in equatorial East Africa and southern Africa where the ENSO?precipitation linkage is most pronounced. In general, there was a reversal in NDVI response patterns in East (southern) Africa from positive (negative) during the El Niño in 1997/98 to negative (positive) during the La Niña event in 1999/2000. These changes can partially be attributed to east?west reversal in SST gradients in the Pacific Ocean basin but more significantly to the changes in the SST anomaly patterns in the equatorial western Indian Ocean (WIO) off the East African coast and the southern Indian Ocean off the southern African coast. }

The highly productive condition had returned by July 1983. Nutrients, phytoplankton biomass, and primary productivity are clearly regulated by the physical changes of El Ni{\~n}o. Evidence from 1982 and 1983 also suggests effects on higher organisms such as fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, but several more years of observation are required to accurately determine the magnitude of the consequences on these higher trophic levels.},

The error due to the atmosphere is least for the channel centered at 3.7 $\Mu$m, which is a real advantage. The use of a linear combination of two or all three of these channels allows one to eliminate most of the atmospheric effect. If instrumental noise of from 0.1 to 0.2 K is accounted for in each channel, the best results are obtained by a combination of the two channels at 3.7 and 12 $\Mu$m.",

    abstract = { Abstract The retrieval (estimation) of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from space-based infrared observations is increasingly performed using retrieval coefficients derived from radiative transfer simulations of top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures (BTs). Typically, an estimate of SST is formed from a weighted combination of BTs at a few wavelengths, plus an offset. This paper addresses two questions about the radiative transfer modeling approach to deriving these weighting and offset coefficients. How precisely specified do the coefficients need to be in order to obtain the required SST accuracy (e.g., scatter <0.3 K in week-average SST, bias <0.1 K)? And how precisely is it actually possible to specify them using current forward models? The conclusions are that weighting coefficients can be obtained with adequate precision, while the offset coefficient will often require an empirical adjustment of the order of a few tenths of a kelvin against validation data. Thus, a rational approach to defining retrieval coefficients is one of radiative transfer modeling followed by offset adjustment. The need for this approach is illustrated from experience in defining SST retrieval schemes for operational meteorological satellites. A strategy is described for obtaining the required offset adjustment, and the paper highlights some of the subtler aspects involved with reference to the example of SST retrievals from the imager on the geostationary satellite GOES-8. }
