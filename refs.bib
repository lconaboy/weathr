    abstract = { Abstract A review is given of the meaning of the term "El NiÃƒÂ±o" and how it has changed in time, so there is no universal single definition. This needs to be recognized for scientific uses, and precision can only be achieved if the particular definition is identified in each use to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding. For quantitative purposes, possible definitions are explored that match the El NiÃƒÂ±os identified historically after 1950, and it is suggested that an El NiÃƒÂ±o can be said to occur if 5-month running means of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the NiÃƒÂ±o 3.4 region (5Ã‚Â°NÃ¢Â€Â“5Ã‚Â°S, 120Ã‚Â°Ã¢Â€Â“170Ã‚Â°W) exceed 0.4Ã‚Â°C for 6 months or more. With this definition, El NiÃƒÂ±os occur 31\% of the time and La NiÃƒÂ±as (with an equivalent definition) occur 23\% of the time. The histogram of NiÃƒÂ±o 3.4 SST anomalies reveals a bimodal character. An advantage of such a definition is that it allows the beginning, end, duration, and magnitude of each event to be quantified. Most El NiÃƒÂ±os begin in the northern spring or perhaps summer and peak from November to January in sea surface temperatures. }

    abstract = { Abstract During the period 1997?2000, the global climate system experienced a transition from the strongest ENSO warm event this century in 1997/98 to a strong cold event in 1999/2000. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument aboard the NOAA polar-orbiting satellite series were analyzed to resolve the land surface response patterns over Africa during this period. The rearrangement of precipitation patterns induced by the change from El Niño to La Niña conditions had significant effects on biomass production in arid and semiarid lands of Africa as revealed by NDVI anomaly patterns, particularly in equatorial East Africa and southern Africa where the ENSO?precipitation linkage is most pronounced. In general, there was a reversal in NDVI response patterns in East (southern) Africa from positive (negative) during the El Niño in 1997/98 to negative (positive) during the La Niña event in 1999/2000. These changes can partially be attributed to east?west reversal in SST gradients in the Pacific Ocean basin but more significantly to the changes in the SST anomaly patterns in the equatorial western Indian Ocean (WIO) off the East African coast and the southern Indian Ocean off the southern African coast. }
