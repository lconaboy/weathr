    abstract = { Abstract A review is given of the meaning of the term "El NiÃƒÂ±o" and how it has changed in time, so there is no universal single definition. This needs to be recognized for scientific uses, and precision can only be achieved if the particular definition is identified in each use to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding. For quantitative purposes, possible definitions are explored that match the El NiÃƒÂ±os identified historically after 1950, and it is suggested that an El NiÃƒÂ±o can be said to occur if 5-month running means of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the NiÃƒÂ±o 3.4 region (5Ã‚Â°NÃ¢Â€Â“5Ã‚Â°S, 120Ã‚Â°Ã¢Â€Â“170Ã‚Â°W) exceed 0.4Ã‚Â°C for 6 months or more. With this definition, El NiÃƒÂ±os occur 31\% of the time and La NiÃƒÂ±as (with an equivalent definition) occur 23\% of the time. The histogram of NiÃƒÂ±o 3.4 SST anomalies reveals a bimodal character. An advantage of such a definition is that it allows the beginning, end, duration, and magnitude of each event to be quantified. Most El NiÃƒÂ±os begin in the northern spring or perhaps summer and peak from November to January in sea surface temperatures. }

    abstract = { Abstract During the period 1997?2000, the global climate system experienced a transition from the strongest ENSO warm event this century in 1997/98 to a strong cold event in 1999/2000. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument aboard the NOAA polar-orbiting satellite series were analyzed to resolve the land surface response patterns over Africa during this period. The rearrangement of precipitation patterns induced by the change from El Niño to La Niña conditions had significant effects on biomass production in arid and semiarid lands of Africa as revealed by NDVI anomaly patterns, particularly in equatorial East Africa and southern Africa where the ENSO?precipitation linkage is most pronounced. In general, there was a reversal in NDVI response patterns in East (southern) Africa from positive (negative) during the El Niño in 1997/98 to negative (positive) during the La Niña event in 1999/2000. These changes can partially be attributed to east?west reversal in SST gradients in the Pacific Ocean basin but more significantly to the changes in the SST anomaly patterns in the equatorial western Indian Ocean (WIO) off the East African coast and the southern Indian Ocean off the southern African coast. }

The use of a linear combination of two or all three of these channels allows one to eliminate most of the atmospheric effect.

    abstract = { Abstract The retrieval (estimation) of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from space-based infrared observations is increasingly performed using retrieval coefficients derived from radiative transfer simulations of top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures (BTs). Typically, an estimate of SST is formed from a weighted combination of BTs at a few wavelengths, plus an offset. This paper addresses two questions about the radiative transfer modeling approach to deriving these weighting and offset coefficients. How precisely specified do the coefficients need to be in order to obtain the required SST accuracy (e.g., scatter <0.3 K in week-average SST, bias <0.1 K)? And how precisely is it actually possible to specify them using current forward models? The conclusions are that weighting coefficients can be obtained with adequate precision, while the offset coefficient will often require an empirical adjustment of the order of a few tenths of a kelvin against validation data. Thus, a rational approach to defining retrieval coefficients is one of radiative transfer modeling followed by offset adjustment. The need for this approach is illustrated from experience in defining SST retrieval schemes for operational meteorological satellites. A strategy is described for obtaining the required offset adjustment, and the paper highlights some of the subtler aspects involved with reference to the example of SST retrievals from the imager on the geostationary satellite GOES-8. }

                 European geostationary meteorological satellites,
                 Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), scheduled for launch
                 in summer 2002. MSG is spin stabilized, as is the
                 current Meteosat series, however, with greatly enhanced
                 capabilities. The 12-channel imager, called the
                 Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraredImager (SEVIRI),
                 observes the full disk of the earth with an
                 unprecedented repeat cycle of 15 min. SEVIRI has eight
                 channels in the thermal infrared (IR) at 3.9, 6.2, 7.3,
                 8.7, 9.7, 10.8, 12.0, and 13.4 µm; three channels in
                 the solar spectrum at 0.6, 0.8, and 1.6 µm; and a
                 broadband high-resolution visible channel. The
                 high-resolution visible channel has a spatial
                 resolution of 1.67 km at nadir; pixels are oversampled
                 with a factor of 1.67 corresponding to a
                 samplingdistance of 1 km at nadir. The corresponding
                 values for the eight thermal IR and the other three
                 solar channels are 4.8-km spatial resolution at nadir
                 and an oversampling factor of 1.6, which corresponds to
                 a sampling distanceof 3 km at nadir. Radiometric
                 performance of all channels exceeds specifications.
                 Thermal IR channels have anonboard calibration with an
                 accuracy better than 1 K. Solar channels are calibrated
                 with an operationalvicarious procedure aiming at an
                 accuracy of 5\%. Meteorological products are derived in
                 the socalled Satellite Application Facilities (SAF) and
                 in the central Meteorological Product Extraction
                 Facility (MPEF) at the EuropeanOrganisation for the
                 Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) in
                 Darmstadt, Germany. The products supportnowcasting,
                 numerical weather prediction (NWP), and climatological
                 applications. The most important product for NWP, the
                 atmospheric motion vectors, are derived from different
                 channels to improve data coverage and quality.
                 Novelproducts are, among others, indices describing the
                 instability of the clear atmosphere and total column
                 ozone. The paper also discusses the use of MSG for
                 future applications, in particular, observations of the
                 rapid cloud development, cloudmicrophysics, and land
                 applications are considered as areas of high potential.
                 As an additional scientificpayload, MSG carries a
                 Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument
                 observing the broadband thermal infrared andsolar
                 radiances exiting the earth-atmosphere system.",
