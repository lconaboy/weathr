Here we will discuss how cloud coverage responds to SSTAs, beginning
with South Africa (Figure \ref{fig:cf_t_south}). Between July 2009 --
March 2010 and November 2014 -- May 2016 the ENSO is in its warm phase,
\elnino{}. If there is a response to the positive ONI in 2009/2010,
then Figure \ref{fig:cf_t_south} indicates that it is insignificant in
our data. During the 2014--2016 \elnino{} period we observe negative
cloud fraction anomalies from November 2014 which switch to positive
cloud fraction anomalies around January 2015. In July 2015, the cloud
fraction anomalies peak and turn around again, steadily decreasing
toward a minimum in March 2016, roughly 3 months after the ONI peaked
in December 2015. Important to note is that in the same time period
that the positive cloud fraction anomalies peak, strong positive SWIO
SSTAs $>0.5\degc$ are also present. Perhaps here the dearth of cloud
coverage that we expect to see in South Africa due to an \elnino{}
event is countered by enhanced SSTAs in the SWIO before the strong ONI
again triumphs in suppressing cloud coverage.

In our time range there are technically four \nina{} periods: November
2008 -- March 2009, June 2010 -- May 2011, July 2011 -- March 2012 and
August 2016 -- December 2016. Two of the periods are separated by only
a month where the ONI dipped to $-0.4\degc$. Following the peak of the
2008/2009 \nina{} in January 2009, there was a significant spike in
the cloud fraction in March 2009.  This positive anomaly is present
despite negative SWIO SSTAs. Similarly, following the peak of the
2010/2011 \nina{} in October 2011, there is a significant positive
cloud fraction anomaly in December of the same year. The 2011/2012 and
2016 \nina{} events both precede positive cloud fraction anomalies by
two months or so, however, due to the large uncertainty on the values,
it would be misguided to label these as significant. It is also worth
noting that the ONI magnitude for the 2011/2012 and 2016 \nina s are
relatively small in comparison to the other events in our time period.

We move now to East Africa, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cf_east}. Immediately before and during the growth of the
2009/2010 \elnino{} we observe negative cloud fractions. Around
October 2009 the cloud fraction anomalies climb rapidly before peaking
in January 2010 at the largest value we observe in our entire dataset
(CF$_{\sigma}=0.88\pm0.59$). This peak in cloud anomalies comes a month
after the peak of the \elnino{} event in December 2009 and coincides
with positive WTIO SSTAs ($>0.25\degc$), present since March 2009 and large
positive WTIO SSTAs ($>0.5\degc$), present since January 2010.
