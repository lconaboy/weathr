    abstract = { Abstract A review is given of the meaning of the term "El Ni{\~n}o" and how it has changed in time, so there is no universal single definition. This needs to be recognized for scientific uses, and precision can only be achieved if the particular definition is identified in each use to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding. For quantitative purposes, possible definitions are explored that match the El Ni{\~n}os identified historically after 1950, and it is suggested that an El Ni{\~n}o can be said to occur if 5-month running means of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Ni{\~n}o 3.4 region (5Ã‚Â°NÃ¢Â€Â“5Ã‚Â°S, 120Ã‚Â°Ã¢Â€Â“170Ã‚Â°W) exceed 0.4Ã‚Â°C for 6 months or more. With this definition, El Ni{\~n}os occur 31\% of the time and La Ni{\~n}as (with an equivalent definition) occur 23\% of the time. The histogram of Ni{\~n}o 3.4 SST anomalies reveals a bimodal character. An advantage of such a definition is that it allows the beginning, end, duration, and magnitude of each event to be quantified. Most El Ni{\~n}os begin in the northern spring or perhaps summer and peak from November to January in sea surface temperatures. }

    abstract = { Abstract During the period 1997?2000, the global climate system experienced a transition from the strongest ENSO warm event this century in 1997/98 to a strong cold event in 1999/2000. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument aboard the NOAA polar-orbiting satellite series were analyzed to resolve the land surface response patterns over Africa during this period. The rearrangement of precipitation patterns induced by the change from El Ni{\~n}o to La Ni{\~n}a conditions had significant effects on biomass production in arid and semiarid lands of Africa as revealed by NDVI anomaly patterns, particularly in equatorial East Africa and southern Africa where the ENSO?precipitation linkage is most pronounced. In general, there was a reversal in NDVI response patterns in East (southern) Africa from positive (negative) during the El Ni{\~n}o in 1997/98 to negative (positive) during the La Ni{\~n}a event in 1999/2000. These changes can partially be attributed to east?west reversal in SST gradients in the Pacific Ocean basin but more significantly to the changes in the SST anomaly patterns in the equatorial western Indian Ocean (WIO) off the East African coast and the southern Indian Ocean off the southern African coast. }

The highly productive condition had returned by July 1983. Nutrients, phytoplankton biomass, and primary productivity are clearly regulated by the physical changes of El Ni{\~n}o. Evidence from 1982 and 1983 also suggests effects on higher organisms such as fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, but several more years of observation are required to accurately determine the magnitude of the consequences on these higher trophic levels.},

The error due to the atmosphere is least for the channel centered at 3.7 $\Mu$m, which is a real advantage. The use of a linear combination of two or all three of these channels allows one to eliminate most of the atmospheric effect. If instrumental noise of from 0.1 to 0.2 K is accounted for in each channel, the best results are obtained by a combination of the two channels at 3.7 and 12 $\Mu$m.",

    abstract = { Abstract The retrieval (estimation) of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from space-based infrared observations is increasingly performed using retrieval coefficients derived from radiative transfer simulations of top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures (BTs). Typically, an estimate of SST is formed from a weighted combination of BTs at a few wavelengths, plus an offset. This paper addresses two questions about the radiative transfer modeling approach to deriving these weighting and offset coefficients. How precisely specified do the coefficients need to be in order to obtain the required SST accuracy (e.g., scatter <0.3 K in week-average SST, bias <0.1 K)? And how precisely is it actually possible to specify them using current forward models? The conclusions are that weighting coefficients can be obtained with adequate precision, while the offset coefficient will often require an empirical adjustment of the order of a few tenths of a kelvin against validation data. Thus, a rational approach to defining retrieval coefficients is one of radiative transfer modeling followed by offset adjustment. The need for this approach is illustrated from experience in defining SST retrieval schemes for operational meteorological satellites. A strategy is described for obtaining the required offset adjustment, and the paper highlights some of the subtler aspects involved with reference to the example of SST retrievals from the imager on the geostationary satellite GOES-8. }

  abstract =     "Abstract The International Satellite Cloud Climatology
                 Project (ISCCP) began in 1983 to collect and analyze
                 weather satellite radiance datasets to produce a new
                 global cloud climatology as part of the World Climate
                 Research Programme. This paper, the first of three,
                 describes the cloud detection part of the ISCCP
                 analysis. Key features of the cloud detection algorithm
                 are 1) use of space and time radiance variation tests
                 over several different space and time domains to
                 account for the global variety of cloudy and clear
                 characteristics, 2) estimation of clear radiance values
                 for every time and place, and 3) use of radiance
                 thresholds that vary with type of surface and climate
                 regime. Design of the detection algorithm was supported
                 by global, multiyear surveys of the statistical
                 behavior of satellite-measured infrared and visible
                 radiances to determine those characteristics that
                 differentiate cloudy and clear scenes and how these
                 characteristics vary among climate regimes. A summary
                 of these statistical results is presented to illustrate
                 how the cloud detection method works in a variety of
                 circumstances. The sensitivity of the results to
                 changing test parameter values is determined to provide
                 a first estimate of the uncertainty of ISCCP cloud
                 amounts. These test results (which exclude polar
                 regions) suggest detection uncertainties of about 10\%
                 with possible negative biases of 5\% (especially at
                 night).",

  abstract =     "Abstract From a dataset of weather observations from
                 land stations worldwide, about 5400 stations were
                 selected as having long periods of record with
                 cloud-type information; they cover all continents and
                 many islands. About 185 million synoptic reports were
                 analyzed for total cloud cover and the amounts of nine
                 different cloud types, for the 26-yr period 1971–96.
                 Monthly and seasonal averages were formed for day and
                 night separately. Time series of total-cloud-cover
                 anomalies for individual continents show a large
                 decrease for South America, small decreases for Eurasia
                 and Africa, and no trend for North America. The largest
                 interannual variations (2.7\%) are found for Australia,
                 which is strongly influenced by ENSO. The zonal average
                 trends of total cloud cover are positive in the Arctic
                 winter and spring, 60°–80°N, but negative in all
                 seasons at most other latitudes. The global average
                 trend of total cloud cover over land is small, −0.7\%
                 decade−1, offsetting the small positive trend that
                 had been found for the ocean, and resulting in no
                 significant trend for the land–ocean average.
                 Significant regional trends are found for many cloud
                 types. The night trends agree with day trends for total
                 cloud cover and for all cloud types except cumulus.
                 Cirrus trends are generally negative over all
                 continents. A previously reported decline in total
                 cloud cover over China and its neighbors appears to be
                 largely attributable to high and middle clouds. Global
                 trends of the cloud types exhibit trade-offs, with
                 convective cloud types increasing at the expense of
                 stratiform clouds, in both the low and middle levels.
                 Interannual variations over Europe, particularly of
                 nimbostratus, are well correlated with the North
                 Atlantic Oscillation; significant correlations are also
                 found across northern Asia. Interannual variations in
                 many parts of the Tropics are well correlated with an
                 ENSO index. Little correlation was found with an index
                 of smoke aerosol, in seven regions of seasonal biomass
                 burning. In the middle latitudes of both hemispheres,
                 seasonal anomalies of cloud cover are positively
                 correlated with surface temperature in winter and
                 negatively correlated in summer, as expected if the
                 direction of causality is from clouds to temperature.",

                 μm and 0.38 μm TOMS reflectivities, along with
                 concurrent surface temperature data from the Air Force
                 3-D nephanalysis, are the primary data sources. They
                 are processed by an algorithm that determines total
                 cloud amount, cloud amount in three altitude
                 categories, cirrus cloud, deep convective cloud, warm
                 cloud, and the radiance of radiation emitted by the
                 clouds. and the underlying surface. The algorithm is of
                 the bispectral threshold type, which yields two
                 independent estimates of total cloud, one from the
                 infrared algorithm and one from the UV reflectivity
                 algorithm. For the daytime observations (local noon at
                 the equator), these two independent estimates are
                 combined to determine a composite estimate, while at
                 night (local midnight at the equator), only the
                 infrared threshold algorithm is used in the estimate.
                 Quantitative validation of total cloud amount was
                 performed by comparing the algorithm results with
                 estimates derived by an analyst interpreting
                 geosynchronous satellite (GOES) images, along with
                 auxiliary meteorological data. It has been concluded
                 that the systematic errors of the Nimbus-7 total cloud
                 amount algorithm relative to the analyst are less than
                 10\%, and that the random errors of daily estimates
                 range between 7\% and 16\%, day or night. These
                 empirical results are consistent with results from a
                 theoretical sensitivity study. Qualitative validation
                 has also been performed by making comparisons with GOES
                 visible and infrared images for specific days. Results
                 indicate that the TOMS cloud estimates improve the IR
                 algorithm estimates of low cloud amount and provide for
                 the identification of cirrus and deep convective cloud,
                 but cloud amounts over humid tropical regions tend to
                 be overestimated even with the use of TOMS. These
                 results suggest that the spatial and temporal
                 characteristics of daily and monthly averaged global
                 cloud cover, including cirrus acid deep convective
                 cloud types, which are presented in Part II, are
                 generally well represented by the Nimbus-7 dataset,
                 which covers a six-year period from April 1979 to March
                 1985.",

                 and is associated with natural disasters and serious
                 social conflicts. Here, using network theory, we
                 construct a directed and weighted climate network to
                 study the global impacts of El Ni{\~n}o and La

                 identification of the regions that are most drastically
                 affected by specific El Ni{\~n}o/La Ni{\~n}a events.
                 Our analysis indicates that the effect of the El
                 Ni{\~n}o basin on worldwide regions is more localized
                 and stronger during El Ni{\~n}o events compared with
                 normal times.Climatic conditions influence the culture
                 and economy of societies and the performance of
                 economies. Specifically, El Ni{\~n}o as an extreme
                 climate event is known to have notable effects on
                 health, agriculture, industry, and conflict. Here, we
                 construct directed and weighted climate networks based
                 on near-surface air temperature to investigate the
                 global impacts of El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a. We find
                 that regions that are characterized by higher

                 {\textquotedblleft}in{\textquotedblright}-weighted
                 links are exhibiting stronger correlations with the El
                 Ni{\~n}o basin and are warmer/cooler during El
                 Ni{\~n}o/La Ni{\~n}a periods. In contrast to non-El
                 Ni{\~n}o periods, these stronger in-weighted activities
                 are found to be concentrated in very localized areas,
                 whereas a large fraction of the globe is not influenced
                 by the events. The regions of localized activity vary
                 from one El Ni{\~n}o (La Ni{\~n}a) event to another;
                 still, some El Ni{\~n}o (La Ni{\~n}a) events are more

  abstract =     "Abstract We investigate the “typical” global and
                 large-scale regional precipitation patterns that are
                 associated with the El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation
                 (ENSO). Monthly precipitation time series from over
                 1700 stations are analyzed using an empirical method
                 designed to identify regions of the globe that have
                 precipitation variations associated with ENSO. Monthly
                 mean ranked precipitation composites are computed over
                 idealized 2-year ENSO episodes for all stations that
                 include data for at least five ENSOs. The amplitude and
                 phase of the Arm harmonic fitted to the 24-month
                 composite values are plotted in the form of a vector
                 for each station. When plotted on a global map, these
                 vectors reveal both the regions of spatially coherent
                 ENSO-related precipitation and the phase of this signal
                 in relation to the evolution of the composite episode.
                 Time cries of precipitation for the coherent regions
                 identified in the harmonic vector map are examined to
                 determine the magnitudes of the ENSO-related
                 precipitation and the percentages of the time the
                 identified relationship actually occurred in
                 conjunction with ENSO episodes. This study expands
                 previous results by placing the regional precipitation
                 relationships into a global framework and by providing
                 a consistent methodology for the definition of the
                 geographical regions and the temporal phase of
                 ENSO-related precipitation. In addition to the Pacific
                 Ocean basin where precipitation patterns could be
                 directly related to the ENSO, several other regions,
                 which showed consistent ENSO-related precipitation,
                 were identified. Specifically, four regions in
                 Australia, two regions each in North America South
                 America, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa and one
                 region in Central America were all found to have
                 coherent ENSO-related precipitation. In most of thew
                 regions, the “season” of ENSO-related precipitation
                 was found to be in phase with the normal annual
                 precipitation cycle. Time series of area-averaged
                 precipitation for the appropriate “seasons” show
                 departures consistent with the composites occurring for
                 at 1east 80\% of the ENSO events in almost every
                 region. The analysis further indicates that variations
                 in precipitation related to ENSO occur as early as
                 April of the composite episode through May of the
                 following year.",

    abstract = { Abstract The ISCCP-C2 cloud climatology is used to describe the three-dimensional structure of cloud diurnal variations and to investigate their relationship to local climatological conditions. The latter follows from the regression of diurnal components onto climatological state variables. Four important diurnal cloud categories are identified. The diurnal variation of maritime high-cloud fraction C′hi maximizes at 1700 local solar time (LST) and is strongest over maritime convective locations where the mean high-cloud fraction is Chi > 0.1. The diurnal variation of maritime low-cloud fraction maximizes at 0400 LST and is strong over maritime nonconvective locations where Chi < 0.1. Diurnal variations of high-cloud fraction (persistent during the night, minimum at 1100 LST) and low-cloud fraction (1300 LST maximum) are strong over all continental locations in the latitude band 40°S–40°N. In each cloud category, most of the diurnal amplitude and phase at individual locations is explained by the regression of diurnal amplitude onto only three climatological state variables. For most categories, the diurnal amplitude has its strongest relationship with mean cloud fraction. The relationship between relative diurnal amplitude (amplitude divided by the mean) and other climatological properties is then particularly meaningful. The relative amplitude of maritime high-cloud fraction is related to the mean total-cloud fraction and the noon-time solar zenith angle, which measures the solar diurnal amplitude. The diurnal amplitude of maritime low-cloud fraction does not have its strongest relationship with the mean low-cloud fraction, but has strong relationships to the upper-level cloud fraction, cloud-top height, and the solar diurnal amplitude. The relative amplitude of continental high-cloud fraction is related most strongly to the time-mean surface temperature, the diurnal amplitude of surface temperature, and the solar diurnal amplitude. The relative amplitude of continental low-cloud fraction has strong relationships with atmospheric moisture content and the diurnal amplitude of surface temperature. In contrast to amplitude, diurnal phase does not exhibit a strong relationship with any climatological variable. Instead, it is uniform within individual categories, which makes cloud diurnal variations independent of geographical location and, therefore, highly spatially coherent. The spatial coherence of cloud diurnal variations makes them an important ingredient of climate, one that affords some predictability in terms of local climatological conditions. }

    abstract = { Abstract The “high index” response of the northeast Pacific westerlies to big positive anomalies of equatorial sea temperature, observed in the winter of 1957–58, has been found to repeat during the major equatorial sea temperature maxima in the winters of 1963–64 and 1965–66. The 1963 positive temperature anomaly started early enough to exert the analogous effect on the atmosphere of the south Indian Ocean during its winter season. The maxima of the sea temperature in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific occur as a result of anomalous weakening of the trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere with inherent weakening of the equatorial upwelling. These anomalies are shown to be closely tied to the “Southern Oscillation” of Sir Gilbert Walker. }

    abstract = { Abstract We examine the importance of pressure gradients due to surface temperature gradients to low-level (p ≥ 700 mb) flow and convergence in the tropics over time scales ≳ 1 month. The latter plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of cumulonimbus convection and rainfall. Our approach is to consider a simple one-layer model of the trade cumulus boundary layer wherein surface temperature gradients are mixed vertically—consistent with ECMWF analyzed data. The top of the layer is taken at 700 mb. The influence from higher levels is intentionally suppressed by setting horizontal pressure gradients and frictional stresses to zero at the top of the layer. Horizontal convergence within the layer is taken up by cumulonimbus mass flux. However, the development of the cumulonimbus mass flux is associated with a short relaxation time [O(½ hr)] (roughly the development time for such convection). During this short time, horizontal convergence acts to redistribute mass so as to reduce horizontal pressure gradients. This effect proves important in the immediate neighborhood of the equator. Our results show that flows forced directly by surface temperature are often comparable to observed low-level flows in both magnitude and distribution. }

    abstract = { Abstract The relationships are examined between precipitation and the high index phase of the Southern Oscillation (SO) for 19 regions of the globe which have documented low SO index-precipitation relationships (Ropelewski and Halpert 1986, 1987). The study reveals that 15 of these regions also show evidence of characteristic precipitation anomalies during the high index phase of the SO. In each of the regions, the high SO index-precipitation relationships show the opposite sign of those documented for the low index. These precipitation relationships were consistent, holding for over 70\% of the high SO index years, and statistically significant. In particular, the high index phase of the SO is associated with enhanced precipitation for the monsoons of India and northern Australia as well as for the rainy seasons in northeastern South America and southeastern Africa. High SO index precipitation was found to be less than median in the central Pacific, Minicoy-Sri Lanka, eastern equatorial Africa, the Gulf of Mexico and northern Mexico region, and southeastern South America. The seasons which showed high SO index-precipitation relationship were almost identical to the masons associated with the low index in 13 of the 15 high SO index regions. Thus to a first approximation, this study suggests that the sign of the precipitation anomaly for these regions is linearly related to the phase of the SO. Since there am 25 low index and 19 high index years in the 109 yr analysis period, from 1875 to 1983, these results further suggest that, for over 40\% of the years precipitation may be classified and perhaps predicted on the basis of the extreme SO phase. }

abstract = {Abstract This is a comprehensive study of the rainfall response over Africa to ENSO episodes in the Pacific. The harmonic method utilized by Ropelewski and Halpert is applied to 90 regionally averaged rainfall time series for the period 1901–1990. The analysis was a composite of 20 episodes within this period. Seasons of maximum positive anomalies and maximum negative anomalies in the composite were identified. The method identifies 15 multiregion sectors where ENSO appears to modulate rainfall. The strongest signals are in eastern equatorial and south‐eastern Africa. A continental‐scale signal is also apparent. The magnitude, seasonal timing and duration, and consistency of the rainfall response to ENSO vary among the sectors and from episode to episode. The rainfall response is clearly seasonally specific. In general, the onset of the ENSO signal in rainfall commences far to the south and propagates latitudinally northward. For this reason, the equatorial regions are out‐of‐ phase with the continental pattern. The ENSO mechanism is probably responsible for many of the well‐established rainfall teleconnections over the continent, including the strong tendency for opposite anomalies in equatorial and southern Africa. There is a strong tendency for positive anomalies to occur during the first half of the ENSO cycle, negative during the second half. This corresponds to ‘cold’ and ‘warm’ phases in the adjacent Atlantic and Indian Oceans; continentally, rainfall tends to be enhanced during the cold phase, reduced during the warm phase. The northward propagation is most pronounced during the cold phase; a similar propagation and phase shift occurs at this time in the Atlantic. The rainfall anomalies of the warm phase are nearly constant in phase, as are the SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean. This suggests that, in general, the Atlantic Ocean controls rainfall during the cold phase, the Indian Ocean during the warm phase. © 1997 by the Royal Meteorological Society.}

    abstract = { Abstract This empirical investigation is devoted to the parsimonious description and diagnostic understanding of large-scale climate variability in the tropics. The role and importance of the Southern Oscillation (SO) over the Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian means is analyzed and compared with other surface circulation modes that contribute to interannual climate variations. Ship data, condensed into clusters of sea level pressure, surface wind, cloudiness, and sea surface temperature, are studied using orthogonally rotated principal component analysis. All four ocean-atmosphere elements are combined in the analysis. Five rotated principal components (PCs) appear as near optimal solutions in both boreal winter and summer. Most of these circulation modes feature a highly correlated, kindred mode in either the preceding or following extreme season, resulting in a preferred 2-year sequence of modes that starts with the boreal summer SO mode. An overall shift in the climate regime of the tropics is found at the end of the 1960s, heralding the recurrent climate extremes of the 1970s. The SO is confirmed as the most important circulation mode. In boreal summer, the second and third PC, called Atlantic Sahel and global Sahel mode, both correlate well with Subsaharan rainfall. The Atlantic Sahel mode focuses on the Atlantic near-equatorial trough, whose northward shift in conjunction with above-average North Atlantic SST has been associated previously with wet West African monsoon seasons. The global Sahel mode complements the Atlantic mode by emphasizing features in the Indian and South Atlantic Ocean domains, in particular, in the SST field which shows strong negative departures for abundant Sahel rainfall years, often preceded by a positively scoring SO mode in boreal winter (i.e., anomalously high/low pressure over the eastern/western Pacific). While the Atlantic Sahel mode relates better to the year-to-year variability of Subsaharan rainfall, the global Sahel mode features a strong negative trend that corresponds best to the long-term downward trend of this climate feature. Since both Sahel modes correlate strongly with precursor modes in boreal winter, some of the Sahel rainfall variance may be foreshadowed a semester in advance. }
