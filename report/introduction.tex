\section{Introduction}

The importance of weather forecasting cannot be understated. We
regularly consult weather forecasts to inform our clothing choices, to
help us decide whether a family outing should be a trip to the beach
or to a museum; should we bring along an umbrella? is it
shirt-and-shorts weather?\footnote{Incidentally it is never
  \emph{shirt-and-\textbf{short}-shorts weather.}} These are
legitimate concerns, but are decidedly \emph{first-world} concerns. In
parts of the world where the amount of rainfall literally means life
or death it is plainly obvious that forewarning of drought is of
paramount importance. Whereas wealthy nations may import food and
water in times of need, much of sub-Saharan Africa relies on the
prosperity of local agriculture to meet dietary needs. Any negative
impact on the harvest -- here we concern ourselves only with
climatological causes -- will severely restrict available food sources
\citep{development2006mapping}. Modern Africa has been plagued by
socioeconomic struggles, with frequent civil war, little access to
education and medicine, and highly unstable governments. While much
progress has been made in recent years\footnote{For more information
  see \url{https://africaindata.org}} the extra stresses of food
shortages and drought may trigger a return to instability.

% bit... insensitive?
In 2016 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(UNOCHA) published a report on the response to \elnino{} in East and
Southern Africa \citep{unocha2016}; by their estimates over 19.5
million people and 10.5 children were affected in East Africa
alone. As a result of \elnino{} parts of East Africa received below
average rainfall leading to poor harvests and food
shortages. Similarly, parts of Southern Africa experienced the worst
drought for 35 years and leading to huge food insecurity. As one of the
worst hit countries, Kenya alone now has over 1.2 million people in a
food security crisis. For this reason, it is imperative that we
improve our understand of and ability to predict this effect in order
that we may better prepare and coordinate responses to prevent
humanitarian disasters.

Early twentieth century observations of atmosphere pressures showed a peculiar
relationship between those measurements in the western tropical Pacific and
those in the southeastern tropical Pacific \citep{holton1989}. Namely, that they
were out of phase --- when one measure was positive, the other was negative. This
was termed the \emph{Southern Oscillation}. Later studies \ref{TODO} would show
that there were accompanying variations in rainfall, sea surface temperatures,
and wind patterns. The combination of these effects would come to be known
collectively as the \elnino{} \emph{Southern Oscillation}, with the warm phase
named \elnino{} and the cold phase \nina{}.

\subsection{Climate science, \elnino{}, and stuff.}

Here we will get into The Physics of the MYTH of climate science -- we all know
it's all a big conspiracy of Big Pharma to control the flow of Potable
Water. Wouldn't want to accidentally forget to include a discussion of Physics --
after all we are students of Physics. We shan't be writing a book and so should
only include the physics relevant to our project. Important things to discuss
are: how \elnino{} is defined and measured (with some brief history), any
science that supports the idea that \elnino{} could affect distant climate --
it's all connected, man.
