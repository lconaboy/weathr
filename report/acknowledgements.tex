%% We would like to offer our sincere thanks to Alfonso
%% Arag\`{o}n-Salamanca and Tony Kent who posed interesting discussion
%% and questions during project progression meetings; to Stephen Powell
%% for his feedback during the literature review and planning stages; and
%% finally to Frazer Pearce whose vast insight and occasional praise was
%% of invaluable measure.

First and foremorst, we would like to thank EUMETSAT for providing the
satellite data necessary for our work, and the NOAA and World Bank for
making climate data freely available. Without the collaborative spirit
shown by these organisations, this project would not have
progressed. We would also like to extend thanks to Frazer Pearce whose
insight and occasional praise were invaluable; and finally to the
School of Physics and Astronomy for affording us the opportunity to
investigate a complex topic somewhat out of the areas of our
(relative) expertise.
