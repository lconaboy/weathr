\section*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to offer our sincere thanks to Alfonso
Arag\`{o}n-Salamanca and Tony Kent who posed interesting discussion
and questions during project progression meetings; to Stephen Powell
for his feedback during the literature review and planning stages; and
finally to Frazer Pearce whose vast insight and occasional praise was
of invaluable measure.

We further extend our thanks EUMETSAT for providing the data necessary
for our project; and to the School of Physics and Astronomy for
affording us the opportunity to investigate a complex topic somewhat
out of the areas of our (relative) expertise.

Finally, we would like to say One Love and Jah Bless. The Lord is
green and sticky. Neither seeds nor stems.
